### Prompt Engineering & Context Management Architecture

#### Multi-Layer Context Management System
ProLaunch.AI employs a sophisticated three-layer context management architecture to ensure consistent, personalized, and accurate AI responses across the entire user journey.

##### Layer 1: Session Context (Redis Cache)
- **Purpose**: Real-time conversation state and active milestone tracking
- **Storage**: Redis with 24-hour TTL
- **Contents**:
  - Current conversation thread (last 10 exchanges)
  - Active milestone progress indicators
  - Temporary calculations and user inputs
  - Session-specific preferences and decisions
- **Retrieval**: Direct key-value lookups, <10ms latency

##### Layer 2: User Journey Context (PostgreSQL + pgvector)
- **Purpose**: Persistent user and business profile data
- **Storage**: PostgreSQL with pgvector extension for semantic search
- **Contents**:
  - All historical chat interactions (embedded with text-embedding-3-small)
  - Generated deliverables with metadata tags
  - User decisions, edited assumptions, and feedback
  - Business profile evolution and key attributes
- **Retrieval**: Hybrid search combining keyword and vector similarity (cosine distance)

##### Layer 3: Knowledge & Reference Context
- **Purpose**: Cross-user insights and reference data
- **Storage**: PostgreSQL with structured indexing
- **Contents**:
  - Industry benchmarks and best practices
  - Supplier database with verified information
  - Template library and successful examples
  - Market research data and competitive intelligence
- **Retrieval**: SQL queries with caching layer

#### Prompt Template Management System

##### Template Structure
Each milestone uses a hierarchical prompt template with the following components:

```yaml
milestone_id: M0_feasibility
version: 1.0.3
components:
  system_prompt:
    role: "You are an expert ecommerce validation specialist..."
    constraints: 
      - "Always provide minimum 3 timestamped citations"
      - "Processing must complete within 60 seconds"
      - "Viability score must be 0-100 with clear rationale"
    output_format: "structured_json"
    
  context_injection_points:
    - user_business_dna: "{business_profile}"
    - previous_milestones: "{completed_milestones}"
    - industry_context: "{market_research}"
    
  task_prompt:
    template: |
      Analyze the following business idea: {user_idea}
      Target market: {target_market}
      Budget range: {budget}
      
      Provide a comprehensive feasibility assessment including:
      1. Viability score with detailed breakdown
      2. Competitive landscape analysis
      3. Recommended pricing strategy
      4. Next steps prioritized by impact
      
  few_shot_examples:
    - input: "organic pet treats, US market, $10k budget"
      output: {example_response}
      
  validation_schema:
    required_fields: ["viability_score", "competitors", "price_range", "next_steps", "citations"]
    citation_minimum: 3
```

##### Version Control & A/B Testing
- All prompt templates stored in Git with semantic versioning
- A/B testing framework for prompt optimization
- Performance metrics tracked per template version
- Automatic rollback on performance degradation

#### Context Orchestration Engine

##### Retrieval Algorithm
```python
# Simplified context retrieval flow
def retrieve_context(user_id, milestone_id, query):
    # 1. Get session context (Redis)
    session_context = redis_client.get(f"session:{user_id}")
    
    # 2. Retrieve relevant user journey data (PostgreSQL + pgvector)
    user_embeddings = pgvector.search(
        query_embedding=embed(query),
        user_id=user_id,
        limit=5,
        similarity_threshold=0.7
    )
    
    # 3. Apply recency decay (recent context weighted 2x)
    weighted_context = apply_recency_weights(user_embeddings)
    
    # 4. Filter by milestone dependencies
    relevant_context = filter_by_dependencies(weighted_context, milestone_id)
    
    # 5. Inject business DNA (persistent attributes)
    business_dna = get_business_profile(user_id)
    
    # 6. Apply token budget allocation
    final_context = allocate_tokens({
        'session': session_context,      # 20% of budget
        'journey': relevant_context,     # 50% of budget
        'business': business_dna,        # 20% of budget
        'examples': few_shot_examples    # 10% of budget
    }, max_tokens=4000)
    
    return final_context
```

##### Dynamic Context Injection
- **Sliding Window**: Last 10 chat exchanges maintained for continuity
- **Semantic Chunking**: Previous deliverables split into 2-3k token chunks
- **Smart Filtering**: Only relevant previous milestones included
- **Context Compression**: Verbose historical data summarized

#### Milestone-Specific Context Patterns

| Milestone | Primary Context | Secondary Context | Token Allocation |
|-----------|----------------|-------------------|------------------|
| M0 (Feasibility) | User idea, market | Industry benchmarks | 2k tokens |
| M1 (Unit Economics) | M0 insights, assumptions | Financial benchmarks | 3k tokens |
| M2 (Research) | M0-M1 data | External market data | 4k tokens |
| M3 (Suppliers) | Product specs from M0-M2 | Supplier database | 3k tokens |
| M4 (Financials) | All economic data M1-M3 | Industry P&L benchmarks | 4k tokens |
| M5 (Positioning) | M2 research, competitors | Brand examples | 3k tokens |
| M6 (GTM) | M5 positioning, budget | Channel performance data | 3k tokens |
| M7 (Website) | M5-M6 brand/marketing | Platform best practices | 3k tokens |
| M8 (Legal) | Business structure, location | Legal templates | 2k tokens |
| M9 (Launch) | All milestone completions | Launch checklist logic | 4k tokens |
